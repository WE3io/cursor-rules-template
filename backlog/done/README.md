# Done Backlog

Completed work items. Items are moved here from `backlog/active/` after implementation and acceptance verification.

## Completion Convention

- Each item gets a brief `**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD — [summary]` note before moving.
- Acceptance checkboxes are checked for verified items.
- See [../active/README.md](../active/README.md) for active work.
