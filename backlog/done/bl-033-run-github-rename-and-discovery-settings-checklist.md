# BL-033: Run GitHub Rename and Discovery Settings Checklist

**Phase:** Now

## 1. Outcome
Post-rename GitHub configuration is applied and documented (repository name, description, topics, social preview, homepage), ensuring external discoverability matches in-repo identity.

## 2. Constraints & References
- This item includes tasks partly outside the repository filesystem (GitHub UI/settings).
- In-repo output should capture checklist completion evidence so status is auditable.
- Keep settings aligned with updated README positioning and supported tool list.

**References:** `README.md`, `implementations/README.md`, `backlog/release-workflow.md`.

## 3. Acceptance Checks
- [ ] GitHub repository name/slug reflects the new project identity.
- [ ] Repository description and homepage are updated to match current project scope.
- [ ] Repository topics include multi-tool AI assistant discoverability tags.
- [ ] Social preview image and short tagline are configured.
- [ ] In-repo checklist note (or decision record) documents completion date and final values used.

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals
- Editing implementation rule logic.
- Automating GitHub settings changes via scripts.
- Managing organization-level branding beyond this repository.
