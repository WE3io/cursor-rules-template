# BL-004: Create Canonical Decision Record Template

**Phase:** Now

## 1. Outcome
Lightweight decision log for accepted/rejected changes. Template captures decision, rationale, alternatives, and risk of no-change.

## 2. Constraints & References
- Record format supports audit and retrospectives.
- Feeds from BL-003 Research Intake and informs BL-006 Change Manifest.

**References:** None.

## 3. Acceptance Checks
- [x] Record template captures: decision, rationale, alternatives, risk of no-change.
- [x] Template documented and available.
- [x] At least one decision recorded using template.

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals
- Formal ADR (Architecture Decision Record) process.
- Automated decision capture.
- Integration with triage workflow (BL-005).
