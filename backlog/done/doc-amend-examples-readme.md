**Completed:** 2026-02-11 — ai-blindspots/examples/README.md added; linked from TOOL_TRANSLATION_GUIDE and ai-blindspots README.

# Add Examples README and Integrate into Navigation

**Phase:** Now

## 1. Outcome
`ai-blindspots/examples/` has a README that describes its purpose and contents. It is linked from `TOOL_TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` and `ai-blindspots/README.md`.

## 2. Constraints & References
- `examples/translation-examples.md` contains side-by-side rule translations.
- `TOOL_TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` covers translation principles.
- `ai-blindspots/README.md` is the main entry point.

**References:** None.

## 3. Acceptance Checks
- [x] `ai-blindspots/examples/README.md` exists and describes purpose and contents.
- [x] `TOOL_TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` links to `examples/` or `translation-examples.md`.
- [x] `ai-blindspots/README.md` includes `examples/` in its "What's Inside" or equivalent section.
- [ ] Root `README.md` "Where to Start" table optionally references examples (if fitting).

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals
- Changing content of `translation-examples.md`.
- Adding new example files.
- Duplicating content from `TOOL_TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` into the examples README.
