**Completed:** 2026-02-11 — ai-blindspots/archive/README.md added with purpose, contents, retention.

# Add Archive README Clarifying Purpose and Retention

**Phase:** Now

## 1. Outcome
`ai-blindspots/archive/` has a README that states its purpose, what it contains, and retention policy (keep vs. historical reference).

## 2. Constraints & References
- Archive contains `original-html/`, `original-rules-v1.0.md`, PDF, and `extract_content.sh`.
- `ai-blindspots/articles/fundamentals/README.md` references `../../archive/original-html/`.

**References:** None.

## 3. Acceptance Checks
- [x] `ai-blindspots/archive/README.md` exists.
- [x] README states purpose (e.g. historical reference, source extraction).
- [x] README lists key contents (original HTML, v1.0 rules, PDF, script).
- [x] README states retention intent (e.g. keep for reference, no active changes).
- [x] Any links from articles to archive remain valid.

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals
- Changing or removing archive contents.
- Migrating or reorganizing archive structure.
- Defining formal archival process.
