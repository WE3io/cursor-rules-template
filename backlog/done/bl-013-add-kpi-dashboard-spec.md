# BL-013: Add KPI Dashboard Spec

**Phase:** Later

## 1. Outcome
Effectiveness metrics for the process. Definitions and cadence for `time-to-update`, `translation parity %`, and `post-release defects` documented.

## 2. Constraints & References
- Metrics must be measurable from existing artifacts (manifests, reports, etc.) or low-friction to collect.
- Spec is documentation; implementation is out of scope.

**References:** BL-006, BL-010, BL-012.

## 3. Acceptance Checks
- [x] `time-to-update` defined (e.g. intake to release).
- [x] `translation parity %` defined (e.g. from BL-010 report).
- [x] `post-release defects` defined (e.g. rollbacks, hotfixes).
- [x] Cadence for each metric documented.
- [x] Spec reviewed and approved.

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals
- Building the dashboard.
- Automating metric collection.
- Setting targets or SLAs.
