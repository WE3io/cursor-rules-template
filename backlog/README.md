# Backlog

Work items and process artifacts.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `active/` | Work items ready for execution (phases: Now, Next, Later) |
| `done/` | Completed work items |
| `intake/` | Research intake queue (candidates from BL-003) |
| `decisions/` | Decision records (BL-004) |
| `manifests/` | Change manifests per release (BL-006) |
| `templates/` | Process templates (schema, intake, criteria, manifest) |

## Completion Convention

When a work item is completed:

1. Add `**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD — [brief outcome]` at the top.
2. Check acceptance checkboxes `[x]` for verified items.
3. Move the file from `active/` to `done/`.
