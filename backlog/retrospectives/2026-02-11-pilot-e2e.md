# Pilot E2E Cycle Retrospective — 2026-02-11

## Summary

One full cycle executed: intake → triage (accept) → canonical edit → Cursor translation → validation → release.

## What Worked

- Intake template (BL-003) sufficient for capture
- Decision record (BL-004) clear for accept/reject
- Change manifest (BL-006) adequate for delta tracking
- Release workflow (BL-012) straightforward
- Parity and QA checks passed

## What to Improve

- **Triage owner (BL-005):** Still TBD; assign owner for sustained triage
- **Intake timestamps:** No explicit `created` field; time-to-update (BL-013) may need file mtime or schema addition
- **Pilot intake size:** Minimal change chosen; larger cycles would surface more integration points

## Follow-Up Backlog Refinements

1. **BL-005:** Assign triage owner in `backlog/triage-workflow.md`
2. **BL-001:** Complete maintainer review of canonical schema
3. **BL-013:** Add optional `created` field to research-intake template if time-to-update measurement desired
4. **Future pilots:** Consider a change that touches multiple tools (not just Cursor) for broader translation validation
