# Decision Record

**Use this template to record decisions on candidate changes (from research intake).**

## Decision

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Intake** | (link or id to research intake) |
| **Decision** | accept / reject / defer |
| **Date** | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Rationale

_Why this decision? What evidence or reasoning?_

## Alternatives Considered

- _Option A: ... (why not chosen)_
- _Option B: ... (why not chosen)_

## Risk of No-Change

_What happens if we do nothing? Why is that acceptable or not?_

---

## Example

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Intake** | sample-intake-001 |
| **Decision** | reject |
| **Date** | 2026-02-11 |

**Rationale:** Sample intake created only to validate BL-003 template. Not a real candidate for canonical change.

**Alternatives:** Accept (no—would add noise); Defer (no—validation complete).

**Risk of No-Change:** None. Template validation succeeded.
