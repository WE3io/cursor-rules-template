## Summary

The context-pollution article recommends restarting at ~20–30 messages; QUICK_REFERENCE already states this. Add a brief intro sentence to the article's "The Blindspot" section that explicitly states the threshold so readers immediately see the actionable number. Improves discoverability without changing guidance.
