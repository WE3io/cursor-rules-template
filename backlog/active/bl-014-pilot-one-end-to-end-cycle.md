# BL-014: Pilot One End-to-End Cycle

**Phase:** Later

## 1. Outcome
Trial run across intake, canonical edits, translation, validation, and release. Retrospective completed and follow-up backlog refinements captured.

## 2. Constraints & References
- Depends on BL-001 through BL-006 (Now) being in place.
- Uses BL-007, BL-008, BL-010, BL-012 where applicable.
- Single cycle; success = learning, not perfection.

**References:** BL-003, BL-005, BL-006, BL-012.

## 3. Acceptance Checks
- [ ] Intake: at least one candidate processed via BL-003 template.
- [ ] Canonical edit: at least one change applied to ai-blindspots.
- [ ] Translation: at least one tool updated (e.g. Cursor).
- [ ] Validation: parity/QA checks run.
- [ ] Release: manifest produced, release executed.
- [ ] Retrospective completed.
- [ ] Follow-up backlog refinements documented.

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals
- Full automation of the cycle.
- All tools translated.
- Production-grade scale.
