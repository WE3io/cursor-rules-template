# Decision Record — sample-intake-001

## Decision

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Intake** | [sample-intake-001](../intake/sample-intake-001.md) |
| **Decision** | reject |
| **Date** | 2026-02-11 |

## Rationale

Sample intake created only to validate BL-003 research intake template. Not a real candidate for canonical change. Template usage verified.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Accept:** No—would add noise to canonical collection.
- **Defer:** No—validation complete; no further action needed.

## Risk of No-Change

None. Template validation succeeded. No impact on canonical guidance.
