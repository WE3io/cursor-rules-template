## Rationale

Minimal additive change; improves discoverability of the 20–30 message threshold. Aligns article intro with QUICK_REFERENCE. Low risk. Pilot cycle validation.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Reject:** No—change is beneficial and low-risk.
- **Defer:** No—appropriate for pilot; small scope.

## Risk of No-Change

Users may miss the threshold when scanning. Low impact; acceptance supports pilot learning.
