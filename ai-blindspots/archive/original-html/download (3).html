state, even if they are available. If state is absolutely necessary,
continuously feeding the current state into the model could help improve
coherence. The RP community probably has quite a lot of lessons here.</p><h2 id=examples>Examples</h2><ul><li>A TypeScript project was divided into three subcomponents: common, backend
and frontend. Each component was its own NPM module. Cursor run from the
root level of the project would have to cd into the appropriate component
folder to run test commands, and would get confused about its current
working directory. It worked much better to instead open up a particular
component as the workspace and work from there.</li></ul></content><p></p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
