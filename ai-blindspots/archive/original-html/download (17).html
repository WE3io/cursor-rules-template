calls. If you are doing agentic coding and there is no bash command
available, if Sonnet decides that it needs to make a file executable, it
will start creating random shell scripts on your filesystem to try in some
weird proxy of the thing they actually wanted to do. It&rsquo;s common for Sonnet
to say, &ldquo;I am going to do X&rdquo; and then generate a tool call for Y, which is
totally different. The best thing to do in this situation is to improve the
prompt (not perfect, Sonnet will forget) or just give Sonnet a tool that
does the thing it wants to do (a specific tool that does one thing will
prevent Sonnet from trying to do a generic bash call.)</li></ul></content><p></p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
