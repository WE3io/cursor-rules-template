AI coding is the epitome of brute force work: you can just brute force large
refactoring problems if you are willing to spend enough tokens, or you can
have the LLM build the workflow you will use to brute force the problem. Look
for opportunity in places where previously people had written off a problem as

Haskell or Rust is when you make a change to some core function, and then
you have to refactor half the universe to account for it (fearless
refactoring, they say, because the type checker will help you fix it). In
many cases, the &ldquo;read compile error, fix the problem&rdquo; loop can be completely
automated by an agentic LLM.</p></li><li><p>I had some test cases with hard coded numbers that had wobbled and needed
updating. I simply asked the LLM to keep rerunning the test and updating
the numbers as necessary.</p></li></ul></content><p></p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
