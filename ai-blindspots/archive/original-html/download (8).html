One of the big wins of AI coding is that LLMs know so many things from their
pretraining.  For extremely popular frameworks that occur prominently in the
pretraining set, an LLM is likely to have memorized most aspects of how to use
the framework.  But for things that are not so common or beyond the knowledge
cutoff, you will likely get a model that hallucinates things.  Ideally, an
agentic model would know to do a web search and find the docs it needs.
However, Sonnet does not currently support web search, so you have to manually
feed it documentation pages as needed.  Fortunately, Cursor makes this very
convenient: simply dropping a URL inside a chat message will include its
contents for the LLM."><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://ezyang.github.io/ai-blindspots/read-the-docs/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="AI Blindspots"><meta property="og:title" content="Read the Docs"><meta property="og:description" content="When you’re learning to use a new framework or library, simple uses of the software can be done just by copy pasting code from tutorials and tweaking them as necessary.

Python function to do some evaluation. Initially, the model hallucinated
how this hookup should work. After providing the manual as context the
model understood how to fix the error and also updated the output format of
its function to match the documentation guidance.</li></ul></content><p></p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
