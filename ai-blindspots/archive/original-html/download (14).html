all.&rdquo; It is incredible that LLMs have this capacity to reunderstand your
codebase from scratch every request. But it is a fragile thing; if the model
fails to get the right files into its context, it can quickly start ripping up
the floors, having gotten into its head the wrong idea of what you are trying
to do.</p><p>Help the model do the right thing: make sure there documentation it can
reference, and make sure the model can find it (e.g., via prompting, or just
putting it where the model expects it to be). Avoid asking for major changes
(where misalignment on the actual goal is more likely to be harmful) without
contextualizing how it should fit together with the project as a whole.</p><h2 id=examples>Examples</h2><ul><li>I asked Sonnet 3.7 to come up with a project plan to come up with a way of
doing end-to-end testing of an already existing project. Sonnet interpreted
this to mean that the raison d&rsquo;etre of the entire repository was testing,
and proceeded to rewrite the README to talk exclusively about testing.</li></ul></content><p></p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
